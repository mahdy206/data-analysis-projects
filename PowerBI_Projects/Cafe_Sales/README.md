## 🔧 Power BI Implementation Steps

### **1. Data Import & Connection**
- Connected to CSV file using "Get Data" → "Text/CSV"
- Loaded data into Power Query Editor

### **2. Data Cleaning & Transformation**

#### **Power Query Steps:**

**A. Replaced Error Values:**
```M
// Replace "ERROR" with null across all columns
= Table.ReplaceValue(#"Previous Step","ERROR",null,Replacer.ReplaceText,{"Item", "Payment Method", "Location", "Total Spent", "Transaction Date"})
```

**B. Replaced Unknown Values:**
```M
// Replace "UNKNOWN" with null
= Table.ReplaceValue(#"Previous Step","UNKNOWN",null,Replacer.ReplaceText,{"Item", "Payment Method", "Location"})
```

**C. Handled Blank Values:**
```M
// Replaced blank strings with null for proper handling
= Table.ReplaceValue(#"Previous Step","",null,Replacer.ReplaceValue,{"Item", "Payment Method", "Location"})
```

**D. Fixed Data Types:**
```M
// Set correct data types
= Table.TransformColumnTypes(#"Previous Step",{
    {"Transaction ID", type text},
    {"Item", type text},
    {"Quantity", Int64.Type},
    {"Price Per Unit", type number},
    {"Total Spent", type number},
    {"Payment Method", type text},
    {"Location", type text},
    {"Transaction Date", type date}
})
```

**E. Calculated Total Sales (Fixed):**
```M
// Recalculated Total Sales from Quantity × Price Per Unit
= Table.AddColumn(#"Previous Step", "Total Sales", each [Quantity] * [Price Per Unit], type number)
```

**F. Filtered Invalid Dates:**
```M
// Removed rows with invalid dates
= Table.SelectRows(#"Previous Step", each [Transaction Date] <> null and [Transaction Date] >= #date(2023,1,1) and [Transaction Date] <= #date(2023,12,31))
```

### **3. Data Model Setup**

#### **Created Dimension Tables:**

**A. DateTable (Calendar Table):**
```DAX
DateTable = 
ADDCOLUMNS(
    CALENDAR(DATE(2023,1,1), DATE(2023,12,31)),
    "Year", YEAR([Date]),
    "Month", FORMAT([Date], "MMM"),
    "MonthNum", MONTH([Date]),
    "Quarter", "Q" & FORMAT([Date], "Q"),
    "Weekday", FORMAT([Date], "dddd"),
    "Day", DAY([Date])
)
```

**B. Products Table:**
- Extracted distinct items from fact table
- Added Product_ID for relationships

**C. Locations Table:**
- Created dimension for In-store vs Takeaway
- Added Location_ID

**D. Payment_Methods Table:**
- Distinct payment types
- Added Payment_ID

#### **Created Relationships:**
- `dirty_cafe_sales[Transaction Date]` → `DateTable[Date]` (Many-to-One)
- `dirty_cafe_sales[Item]` → `Products[Item]` (Many-to-One)
- `dirty_cafe_sales[Location]` → `Locations[Location]` (Many-to-One)
- `dirty_cafe_sales[Payment Method]` → `Payment_Methods[Payment Method]` (Many-to-One)

### **4. DAX Measures Created**

```DAX
// Total Revenue
Total Sales = SUM(dirty_cafe_sales[Total Sales])

// Total Transactions
Total Transactions = COUNTROWS(dirty_cafe_sales)

// Average Order Value
Average Order Value = 
DIVIDE(
    [Total Sales],
    [Total Transactions],
    0
)

// Total Quantity Sold
Total Quantity = SUM(dirty_cafe_sales[Quantity])

// Items Per Transaction
Items Per Transaction = 
DIVIDE(
    [Total Quantity],
    [Total Transactions],
    0
)

// Distinct Items Sold
Distinct Items = DISTINCTCOUNT(dirty_cafe_sales[Item])

// Average Transaction Value
Average Transaction = 
DIVIDE(
    [Total Sales],
    [Total Transactions],
    0
)

// Price Per Unit
Price Per Unit = 
DIVIDE(
    [Total Sales],
    [Total Quantity],
    0
)

// Total Locations (Active)
Total Locations = DISTINCTCOUNT(dirty_cafe_sales[Location])

// Total Spent (Alternative name for Total Sales)
Total Spent = [Total Sales]

// Percentage of Total
% of Total Sales = 
DIVIDE(
    [Total Sales],
    CALCULATE([Total Sales], ALL(Products)),
    0
)
```

## 📝 Data Cleaning Decisions

### **Why This Approach:**

1. **Replaced ERRORs with null:** Allows for proper aggregation and filtering
2. **Kept original columns:** Maintains data lineage for auditing
3. **Created calculated Total Sales:** Ensures consistency across calculations
4. **Created dimension tables:** Enables better performance and flexibility
5. **Filtered invalid dates:** Prevents skewed temporal analysis

### **Alternative Approaches Considered:**
- Could replace nulls with "Unknown" category (opted for null to show data quality issues)
- Could exclude error rows entirely (opted to keep for transparency)
- Could impute missing values (opted not to, to preserve data integrity)
